    "The introduction of online payment systems has helped a lot in the ease of payments. But, at the same time, it increased in payment frauds.Online payment frauds can happen with anyone using any payment system, especially while making payments using a credit card. That is why detecting online payment fraud is very important for credit card companies to ensure that the customers are not getting charged for the products and services they never paid."
